# Netflix Clone

This is a netflix clone I built using ReactJS, Emotion, Axios, Firebase, and the tmdb API. I built the project to built on my experience working wih APIs and to learn to mimic the UI of high-quality web apps. The app is responsive to different screen dimensions, including mobile. 

Built with
- [react](https://reactjs.org/)
- [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

## Getting Started
